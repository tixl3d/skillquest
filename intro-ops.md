# An introduction to math.  &otaAKv9

## Info(ValueQuiz)  &CzEdyEL
Some people have not to good memories about math because most teachers couldn't give a good reason, why you would need that for.

In TiXL working using math is fun and intuitive. This following levels will teach you everything you need to know...

## Info(Value)  &SdzTkb8
In TiXL you can use math operators to control parameters and animation.

There are different "types" of numbers. We will start with float-values and cover other types later...

## Info(Value)  &HCzQrbs
Connect this op to the [ValueQuiz].

## Info(ValueQuiz)  &RjUQ59h
The [ValueQuiz] show a required value and a graph at the bottom.

Try to find the value, the to solve that goal...

## Info(Value)  &o2Pj657
The most basic Operator is [Value].

You can edit its parameter with different methods:

1. Select the Operator and use the Parameter Window.

2. Drag on the Operator in the graph while holding the CTRL key.




# Take that value!  &8R86EjU

## Info(RoundedRect)  &hLeRt0s
When you selected an operator, the Parameter Window will show its parameters.

## Info(RoundedRect)  &7zmQq5L
Notice how the Scale parameter is lit up.

That's because it was changed it from its default value. 

Try clicking the parameter name "Scale" to reset it,

## Info(RoundedRect)  &m6rVqOd
Sometimes we want things to be more dynamic. It looks like the "Rotate" parameter needs to be controlled.

## Info(Time)  &2wuPR9p
The [Time] operator would be perfect for this!

But when you try moving it close to the [RoundedRect] it doesn't snap! 

That's because [Time] returns a numeric value, but [RoundedRect] expects an Image as default input.

## Info(Time)  &QpAMfeX
Try dragging a connection from the [Time]'s output connector...

Do you notice how a small circle starts blinking on the [RoundedRect]? 

That's an indicator that it has "hidden" parameters (like the Rotate) that would accept a numeric input... 

## Info(RoundedRect)  &ckYNrte
Drop the end of the connection onto the [RoundedRect] and pick Rotate from the popup.

## Info &HHcPfRz
If you want to tidy things up, you can now snap to the connected input.


# I01c_Kalaidos  &mGUEmCV

## Info(MirrorRepeat)  &xJD23Dd
Frequently combining multiple copies of an Operator can lead to very interesting effects.

Consider this challenge: It looks like the [LinearGradient] is being repeated twice to form this interesting pattern.

## Info(LinearGradient)  &YgvV61e
You need to adjust two parameters of this [LinearGradient]. Can you find, which ones?


# Where the Path Begins  &HVoGwBo

## Info(RoundedRect)  &esJrfth
In these first Levels I will walk you through the basics of using the TiXL's node graph.

## Info(ImageQuiz)  &HkJaGm6
Each Level shows its solution on the bottom. 

Your task is to replicate that solution by using the available Operators and connect them to the [Quiz] operator on the right.



## Info(RoundedRect)  &SNlmZeY
Tip: If you get stuck, you can always expand and take a look at the Solution.

## Info(RoundedRect)  &mszyfJn
Let's start by learning how to connect Operators:

Find the [ImageQuiz] operator and drag a connection from its output connector onto the [ImageResult].

2. Drag on the Operator in the graph while holding the CTRL key.




# Riding the wave  &8l0343U

## Info(Sin)  &5J3IWfb
You can use the [Sin] operator to create a wave form. (And yes, "Sine" would have been a better name...)

## Info(Time)  &Mgi7wIR
You will need to connect an animated value like this [Time] Operator to get it moving...

## Info(Time)  &Yp6fViA
You will need to adjust the Speed Factor parameter to match the goal.


# Get outta there!  &oqMRuV8

## Info(Blob)  &5ywJl3n
Sometimes it's useful to drag an Operator out of a stack...

That orange [Blob] Operator is really bright! 

Try to remove it from the stack: Just long-press and dragging it out...




# The Dark Sun  &iKP3QCU

## Info &HllsRDn
This tour is not ready yet


# Saw!  &pFkvoXT

## Info(Modulo)  &dNRLyhV
If the shape of the [Sin] Operator is too smooth we can use the [Modulo] Operator to generate a saw shape.

Modulo keeps a value looping so it never grows past a chosen limit and always jumps back to the start when it reaches it.

## Info(Time)  &AiNVGwU
Snap the [Time] to the [Modulo]...

## Info(Modulo)  &ZpuWjcZ
Connect the [Modulo] to the [ValueQuiz].

## Info(Modulo)  &fdCVHE7
Adjust the [Modulo] parameter to match the goal.


# Swimming upwards...  &jEz14gc

## Info(RoundedRect)  &olR30GJ
We've seen the [RoundedRect] Operator before. For this example, we can leave all of it's parameters as they are.

## Info(MirrorRepeat)  &fxAa2u8
Instead we're going to focus on the [MirrorRepeat] Operator.

In the jack of all trades related to reflecting images along an axis.

To reproduce the example below you only have to adjust two of its parameters.


# Simple Chaos  &kr1bqNi

## Info &4Q1Jigk
Combining just a few simple operators can have surprising and unexpected results.

## Tip(Time)  &SxGS0XA
Tip: You might need to use [Time]'s output multiple times...


# So much time...  &AY4SKrL

## Info(Value:3)  &Tk717Br
Sometimes dealing with numbers is hard. Why not let TiXL do that work for us?

## Info(Value:3)  &T4fIsVF
We renamed these  [Value] operators by hitting the Return-key...

## Info(Value:3)  &DxYRgWF
You can zoom into the graph see the current values of the Operators.

## Info(Multiply)  &RoX0akt
Try to multiply all tree values...

To connect the second input remember to drag the output connectors onto the [Multiply] operatoprs and look for the blinking dot. 


# Stack Attack  &py8vfdI

## Info(RoundedRect)  &G70qVyl
TiXL's node graph can snap Operators into horizontal or veritical stacks. 

This is great because it greatly reduces "noodle salad". It also let's you quickly move snapped stacks around.



## Info(RoundedRect)  &UjKuxop
When you drag Operators they near to something matching, they will automatically snap and connect.

Try draging the [RoundedRect] towards the [Blob]...

## Info(RoundedRect)  &GmYDs1r
If you drag on a non-selected Operator, you can move a complete stack.

Click and hold longer the left mouse button longer, to separate an Operator.

## Info(RoundedRect)  &8ye7X9m
To remove connections, you can "shake"  an Operator.

## Info(RoundedRect)  &Oole6GS
You can also press Ctrl+Z to undo disconnecting and movement.

## Info(Raster)  &iGh0wop
Tip: You can also snap Operators into vertical stacks.

## Info(ImageQuiz)  &5qzgdcg
To complete the level, stack the [RoundedRect], [Blob] and [Raster] onto the [ImageQuiz] Operator.


# Speed it up!  &T7WeT4E

## Info(RoundedRect)  &4810LcS
This [RoundedRect] operator might be rotating... But it's so slow that it's barely noticable.

That's because TiXL uses degrees for angles and waiting 360 seconds for a complete turn takes a long time.

## Info(Multiply)  &Sicxwam
Maybe we can speed things up by inserting that [Multiply] operator...

Try dragging it between [Time] and [RoundedRect].
