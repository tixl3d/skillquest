# Trigger-Based Animation

## Info
One powerful use of triggers is the [TriggerAnim] operator.

It is similar to [AnimValue], but it does not follow time directly. Instead, it reacts to events.

## Info
In this example, [HasValueChanged] sends a trigger whenever a noisy value increases.

This trigger starts an animation, which is then used to sample a color from a gradient.

## Info
In real projects, trigger signals can come from many sources.

They might be audio levels, MIDI input, OSC messages, sensors, or other external events.
