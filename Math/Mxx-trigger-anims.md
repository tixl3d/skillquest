# Trigger Anim

## Info

A very powerful use case for triggers is the [TriggerAnim].

It’s very similar to his sibling [AnimValue] but does not respond to time but to events.

## Info

In this example, we use the [HasValueChanged] operator to send and event every time the noisy value has increased.

We can use this signal to trigger an animation. And we can use this to sample a color from a gradient.

## Info

Of course in real projects the signal could be everything from an audio level, to a midi controller input to some message sent via OSC.

## CallToAction

Try to solve the puzzle.

# Shake it like camera picture!

## CallToAction

In this example we build a small camera shake effect.

All parameters are already set. You only need to connect the operators correctly.

# Keeping things Complex

## Info

In this final example we bring everything together and build a complex animation.

## CallToAction

Once again, all parameters are already set correctly. You only have to figure out how to connect the operators.
